To note:
- updates could break step 1, so it has to be repeated for each update maybe

1. IMPORTANT, modify gameinfo.txt in these locations: "left4dead2", "left4dead2_dlc1", "left4dead2_dlc2", "left4dead2_dlc3", "update" to include this line AT THE TOP OF FILE ORDER in SearchPaths section 
"Game        modified_game_sounds"

2. place "modified talker.vpk" inside addons folder

3. place "modified_game_sounds" folder next to other dlc packs in l4d2 root folder, this contains the game_sounds_* files for survivors packed in a vpk for the game to read instead of default

4. Enjoy coach
